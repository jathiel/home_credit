## Project Description
The Home Credit Group (HCG) is looking to develop a model with which they can determine the amount of risk associated with a particular loan. Such models are referred to as 'scorecards'. The main concern is that scorecards may need to be updated constantly based on customer behavior over time, which means that they may lack any kind of predictive ability. The goal is to develop a scorecard that can predict credit defaults prior to their occurance and be 'stable' over time. The data provided encompass a wide variety of categories, but no credit scores.

## Stakeholders
The HCG is the primary stakeholder in this project.
